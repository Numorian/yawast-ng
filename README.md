## YAWAST [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adamcaudill/yawast.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adamcaudill/yawast) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/adamcaudill/yawast.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/adamcaudill/yawast) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/adamcaudill/yawast/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/adamcaudill/yawast?branch=master) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/yawast.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/yawast)

**The YAWAST Antecedent Web Application Security Toolkit**

YAWAST is an application meant to simplify initial analysis and information gathering for penetration testers and security auditors. It performs basic checks in these categories:

* TLS/SSL - Versions and cipher suites supported; common issues.
* Information Disclosure - Checks for common information leaks.
* Presence of Files or Directories - Checks for files or directories that could indicate a security issue.
* Common Vulnerabilities
* Missing Security Headers

This is meant to provide a easy way to perform initial analysis and information discovery. It's not a full testing suite, and it certainly isn't Metasploit. The idea is to provide a quick way to perform initial data collection, which can then be used to better target further tests. It is especially useful when used in conjunction with Burp Suite (via the `--proxy` parameter).

### Installing

The simplest method to install is to use the RubyGem installer:

`gem install yawast`

This allows for simple updates (`gem update yawast`) and makes it easy to ensure that you are always using the latest version.

YAWAST requires Ruby 2.2+, and is tested on Mac OSX and Linux (Windows should work; please open a ticket if you have issues).

* Supported ciphers
* Maximum requests in a single connection

Checks for the following SSL issues are performed:

* Expired Certificate
* Self-Signed Certificate
* MD5 Signature
* SHA1 Signature
* RC4 Cipher Suites
* Weak (< 128 bit) Cipher Suites
* SWEET32

In addition to these tests, certain basic information is also displayed, such as IPs (and the PTR record for each IP), HTTP HEAD request, and others.

### TLS / SSL Testing

YAWAST offers two modes for testing TLS / SSL - one is custom, and most useful for internal systems, and the other uses the [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) API.

#### Internal Mode

To use the custom internal TLS / SSL scanner (which uses your copy of OpenSSL), simply pass `--internalssl` on the command line. Here is a sample of the output generated by this tester.

```

This version is more limited than the SSL Labs option, though will work in cases where SSL Labs is unable to connect to the target server.

#### SSL Labs Mode

The default mode is to use the SSL Labs API, which makes all users bound by their [terms and conditions](https://www.ssllabs.com/downloads/Qualys_SSL_Labs_Terms_of_Use.pdf), and obviously results in the domain you are scanning being sent to them.

This mode is the most comprehensive, and contains far more data than the Internal Mode. Unless there is a good reason to use the Internal Mode, this is what you should use.

### Usage

* Standard scan: `./yawast scan <url> [--internalssl] [--tdessessioncount] [--nossl] [--nociphers] [--dir] [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`
* HEAD-only scan: `./yawast head <url> [--internalssl] [--tdessessioncount] [--nossl] [--nociphers] [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`
* SSL information: `./yawast ssl <url> [--internalssl] [--tdessessioncount] [--nociphers]`
* CMS detection: `./yawast cms <url> [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`

For detailed information, just call `./yawast -h` to see the help page. To see information for a specific command, call `./yawast -h <command>` for full details.

### Using with Burp Suite

By default, Burp Suite's proxy listens on localhost at port 8080, to use YAWAST with Burp Suite (or any proxy for that matter), just add this to the command line:

`--proxy localhost:8080`

### Authenticated Testing

For authenticated testing, YAWAST allows you to specify a cookie to be passed via the `--cookie` parameter.

`--cookie SESSIONID=1234567890`

### Sample

Using `scan` - the normal go-to option, here's what you get when scanning my website:

```
$yawast scan https://adamcaudill.com --tdessessioncount --dir

### About The Output

You'll notice that most lines begin with a letter in a bracket, this is to tell you how to interpret the result at a glance. There are four possible values:

* [I] - This indicates that the line is informational, and doesn't necessarily indicate a security issue.
* [W] - This is a Warning, which means that it could be an issue, or could expose useful information. These need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the impact.
* [V] - This is a Vulnerability, it indicates an issue that is known to be an issue, and needs to be addressed.
* [E] - This indicates that an error occurred, sometimes these are serious and indicate an issue with your environment, the target server, or the application. In other cases, they may just be informational to let you know that something didn't go as planned.

The indicator used may change over time based on new research or better detection techniques. In all cases, results should be carefully evaluated within the context of the application, how it's used, and what threats apply. The indicator is guidance, a hint if you will, it's up to you to determine the real impact.

### About The Name

When this project was started, the original name was "Yet Another Web Application Security Tool" - as the project became more serious, the name was changed. The current name better reflects the role of the tool, and its place in the penetration tester's workflow. It's meant to be a first step, to come before the serious manual work, and provide information to allow a tester to be up and running quicker. The tests that are performed are based on that goal, as well as the availability and complexity of tests in other tools. If another common tool can do a given task better, it won't be done here.
