### What does the name mean?

When this project was started, the original name was "Yet Another Web Application Security Tool" - as the project became more serious, the name was changed. The current name better reflects the role of the tool, and its place in the penetration tester's workflow. It's meant to be a first step, to come before the serious manual work, and provide information to allow a tester to be up and running quicker. The tests that are performed are based on that goal, as well as the availability and complexity of tests in other tools. If another common tool can do a given task better, it won't be done here.
