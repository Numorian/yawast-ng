## YAWAST [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adamcaudill/yawast.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adamcaudill/yawast) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/adamcaudill/yawast.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/adamcaudill/yawast) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/adamcaudill/yawast/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/adamcaudill/yawast?branch=master)

**The YAWAST Antecedent Web Application Security Toolkit**

YAWAST is an application meant to simplify initial analysis and information gathering for penetration testers and security auditors. It performs basic checks in these categories:

* TLS/SSL - Versions and cipher suites supported; common issues.
* Information Disclosure - Checks for common information leaks.
* Presence of Files or Directories - Checks for files or directories that could indicate a security issue.
* Common Vulnerabilities
* Missing Security Headers

This is meant to provide a easy way to perform initial analysis and information discovery. It's not a full testing suite, and it certainly isn't Metasploit. The idea is to provide a quick way to perform initial data collection, which can then be used to better target further tests. It is especially useful when used in conjunction with Burp Suite (via the `--proxy` parameter).

* *(Generic)* Info Disclosure: X-Powered-By header present

* *(ASP.NET)* Presence of Trace.axd
* *(ASP.NET)* Presence of Elmah.axd
* *(ASP.NET)* Debugging Enabled
* *(nginx)* Info Disclosure: Server version

CMS Detection:

* Generic (Generator meta tag) *[Real detection coming as soon as I get around to it...]*

SSL Information:

* Certificate details
* Certificate chain
* Supported ciphers
* Maximum requests in a single connection

Checks for the following SSL issues are performed:

* Expired Certificate
* Self-Signed Certificate
* MD5 Signature
* SHA1 Signature
* RC4 Cipher Suites
* Weak (< 128 bit) Cipher Suites

In addition to these tests, certain basic information is also displayed, such as IPs (and the PTR record for each IP), HTTP HEAD request, and others.

### TLS / SSL Testing

YAWAST offers two modes for testing TLS / SSL - one is custom, and most useful for internal systems, and the other uses the [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) API.

#### Internal Mode

To use the custom internal TLS / SSL scanner (which uses your copy of OpenSSL), simply pass `--internalssl` on the command line. Here is a sample of the output generated by this tester.

```

This version is more limited than the SSL Labs option, though will work in cases where SSL Labs is unable to connect to the target server.

#### SSL Labs Mode

The default mode is to use the SSL Labs API, which makes all users bound by their [terms and conditions](https://www.ssllabs.com/downloads/Qualys_SSL_Labs_Terms_of_Use.pdf), and obviously results in the domain you are scanning being sent to them.

This mode is the most comprehensive, and contains far more data than the Internal Mode. Unless there is a good reason to use the Internal Mode, this is what you should use.

### Usage

* Standard scan: `./yawast scan <url> [--internalssl] [--nossl] [--nociphers] [--dir] [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`
* HEAD-only scan: `./yawast head <url> [--internalssl] [--nossl] [--nociphers] [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`
* SSL information: `./yawast ssl <url> [--internalssl] [--nociphers]`
* CMS detection: `./yawast cms <url> [--proxy localhost:8080] [--cookie SESSIONID=12345]`

For detailed information, just call `./yawast -h` to see the help page. To see information for a specific command, call `./yawast -h <command>` for full details.

### Using with Burp Suite

By default, Burp Suite's proxy listens on localhost at port 8080, to use YAWAST with Burp Suite (or any proxy for that matter), just add this to the command line:

`--proxy localhost:8080`

### Authenticated Testing

For authenticated testing, YAWAST allows you to specify a cookie to be passed via the `--cookie` parameter.

`--cookie SESSIONID=1234567890`

### Sample

Using `scan` - the normal go-to option, here's what you get when scanning my website:

```
$yawast scan https://adamcaudill.com --sslsessioncount --dir
